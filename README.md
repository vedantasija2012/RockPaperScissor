I have made a Rock paper and Scissors Game usingC++ Programming language.
Computer gives you three choices, i.e. 
1. Rock (r)
2. Paper (p)
3. Scissors (s)
Case 1:
If you choose r and comp choose p, then you will win
Case 2:
If you choose p and comp choose r, then you will loose
Case 3:
If you choose r and comp choose s, then you will loose
Case 4:
If you choose s and comp choose r, then you will win
Case 5:
If you choose s and comp choose p, then you will loose
Case 6:
If you choose p and comp choose s, then you will win
Case 7:
Rest are Draw conditions:
i) you = r, comp = r
ii) you = p, comp = p
iii) you = s, comp = s
